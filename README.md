ServerStatus
============
ServerStatus is a little sysop helper for Mac OS X to monitor your (or someone
others) servers. ServerStatus periodically pings the servers you specified and
reports back their status. It resides in the menu bar so you can always see the
current status of all servers in the list.

I started to develop two now features a long time ago in the two branches
*newMenu* and *newServices* but did not get very much code written. Since I
don't find time to produce more code I provide the source to the community. May
this help this little tool to get somewhere :).
I plan to continue developing on my first Obj-C app so patches are welcome.

The ServerStatus icon is from [Artua Design Studio](http://www.artua.com/). They
were very kind and allowed me to use it.
