ServerStatus
============
ServerStatus is a little sysop helper for Mac OS X to monitor your (or someone
others) servers. ServerStatus periodically pings the servers you specified and
reports back their status. It resides in the menu bar so you can always see the
current status of all servers in the list.

The ServerStatus icon is from [Artua Design Studio](http://www.artua.com/). They
were very kind and allowed me to use it.
